My assignment was to create a piece of generative art to display on the Becton Laboratory screens.

I created a generative art project using a piece of software called processing. In order to re-create my project, you would need a computer with processing downloaded and an HDMI out from that computer. It is as simple as opening final.pde, downloading the corresponding png files, putting them in the final.pde sketchbook folder, and pressing the play button. Doing this will display on one’s laptop screen quite nicely. 

I decided upon using a combination of different Yale crests and comforting colors to create the feeling of belonging to what these crests represent. Here is a link to a video demonstration of my project.
